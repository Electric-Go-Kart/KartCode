# Kart Code

Year: 2021/2022

This is the code for our electric go kart senior design project. This repo was forked from [Electric-Go-Kart/ArduinoCode](https://github.com/Electric-Go-Kart/ArduinoCode), which is the repo from last year's team.

The Prototype Code runs through updates out to steering, throttle, and lights.

The Modules folder contains each of the bits of code which are used for sensing and outputting data.
  They are sorted into types of data and will be implemented into each code block which will require it. 
  
The Full Kart Code takes in data from the throttle pedal and outputs the UART signal to the VESC which controls the motors.
  A second section will be responsible for the data collection and non vital operations.
